Address descriptor: Store as a list with a tuple for each entry [ {s, } {m, } {r,}]
Register descriptor: List of registers with a list for each register about which variables it stores
In arithmetic operations, overflow is not considered
When designing three address code, make sure 

x = y op z mein agar dono digit hain to wo case skip kiya hain 

getreg() will always return a register

* For any array, say a[i], a can never be in register
 

TAC Design:
i) Operations like x = y op z where y & z both are contants are converted to the form x=y' where y' is constant and equal to y op z
   where op can be arithmetic/binary/logical operator
ii) x = ~ y then y must be variable
iii) &&, ||, ! cannot be directly implemented in assembly so make appropriate changes while writing TACssss
iv) print x (x can be variable as well as constant)
v) If x goto line number: convert this  to if x!0 goto line number
